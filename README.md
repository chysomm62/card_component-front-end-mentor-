## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learnt more about flex boxes
- Learnt about image alignment

```css
.card > * {
  flex: 1 50%;
}
.card {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
  height: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

- Using the picture tag to get different images display on different screen sizes. I tried this but it didn't work.

### Useful resources

- Google
- stackoverflow
